## Key Points

- The Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered application that monitors regulatory changes across configurable domains (e.g., AML) and jurisdictions using Claude AI for automated analysis and decision support
- User journey spans seven phases from initial dashboard access through scan configuration, backend orchestration, results review, workflow management, knowledge store curation, and document export
- Backend agent orchestration includes six execution stages: initializing, retrieving sources, detecting changes via keyword analysis, AI-powered impact analysis, confidence scoring with human review flags, and artifact generation
- Claude AI analyzes each regulatory document to determine relevance, impact level (Low/Medium/High/Critical), affected compliance areas, recommended actions, and confidence scores
- Items with confidence scores below 0.7 or requiring human review are flagged; verified items transition through a workflow (Draft → In Review → Verified) before being added to a searchable knowledge store
- System generates professional Word documents (.docx) and markdown artifacts for compliance documentation and export

## Entities and Topics

- **Regulatory Tracker**: AI-powered compliance monitoring application that automates regulatory change detection and analysis
